<p>Lately, my friend was asking me how to set up python environment since he had tried many times on his windows based enviroment.
I’m have few experience though and all of them is on Linux. All I can recall was about the embedded porting for SAMBA application 
in which some codes relates to python and some material for toolchain that is used scripts in python.</p>

<p>Here I note the steps for someone who needs as reference as well as for my friend.</p>

<p>– Install Anaconda
Anaconda already is good start for rookie (like me) to prement of conflictions on package installation.
We can find the latest one on https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and just clicking “next step” until installation sucessfully.
After installation, we can open Anaconda Prompt with admin user.
Check the conda version</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">conda <span class="nt">--version</span>
<span class="c"># conda 4.5.11</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Under Anaconda Prompt, create an enviornment which is based on python 3.5.2.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">conda create <span class="nt">-n</span> opencv_py352_demo <span class="nv">python</span><span class="o">=</span>3.5.2</code></pre></figure>

<p>Check one of env you created, naming opencv_py352_demo</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">conda info <span class="nt">--envs</span>
<span class="c"># conda environments:</span>
<span class="c">#</span>
base                     C:<span class="se">\P</span>rogramData<span class="se">\A</span>naconda3
opencv_py352_demo     <span class="k">*</span>  C:<span class="se">\P</span>rogramData<span class="se">\A</span>naconda3<span class="se">\e</span>nvs<span class="se">\o</span>pencv_py352_demo</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you want to check all envs. and remove some of them, you can type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">conda remove <span class="nt">--name</span> myenv <span class="nt">--all</span>
conda <span class="nb">env </span>remove <span class="nt">--name</span> myenv</code></pre></figure>

<p>Install opencv</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">conda <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-c</span> https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3</code></pre></figure>

<p>– Spyder and SciPy
Spyder editor is strong IDE tools, and likes MATLAB env and for mathematics, science, and engineering also 
I will include SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) lib, matplotlib to make them looks more like using under MATLAB
which i familar with</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">Install spyder
conda <span class="nb">install </span>spyder</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">Install matplotlib
conda <span class="nb">install </span>matplotlib</code></pre></figure>

<p>open spyder IDE</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">spyder</code></pre></figure>

<p>Run an example on spyder</p>
